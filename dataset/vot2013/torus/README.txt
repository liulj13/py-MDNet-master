This image sequence and the attached annotations were used in the experimental
section of the paper "An adaptive coupled-layer visual model for robust 
visual tracking", published at the ICCV 2011.

=== Annotations ===

The annotations are stored in an AVT file, which is a ZIP-based file format
designed for storing annotations for visual tracking. Inside you can find
several plain-text files. Information like bounding boxes can be extracted
from a CSV-formatted 'rectangles' file. More about the format will be published
soon along with a GUI for editing annotations.

=== Citing ===
